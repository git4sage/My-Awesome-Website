# Front End Web Development Project 

"**TURF TAILORS**" Website

My project is a lawncare website designed to simulate what an actual lawncare website might be.
It contains a photos page to display photos of work. The site contains a services page displaying what services the company offers. The website also contains an about page and a contact page. Hopefully this might be able to be used as a real website one day.

Features included are as follows:

    1. CSS feature, Main nav bar expands and collapses at desktop and movile sizes.
    2. JavaScript feature, Drop menu showing content area including list of services offered as links to that specific part of page when clicked on.
    3. JavaScript feature, Price Quote Estimator that performs a mathematical operation that outputs a price quote and displays it on the page.

Media Query Breakpoints:

    1. 600px
    2. 992px

*Special Insturctions:*
- to access services dropdown button, simply hover over "Services" on the services page and click, then select your desired service and you will be routed to that portion of the page. 
- to use the "Price Quote Estimator" simply enter the square footage of the lawn into the box and click the "Calculate" button. For example if you enter 15000 the calculator will output $37.50.
