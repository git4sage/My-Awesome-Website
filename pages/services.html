  <div class="serveinfo">
      <h2 id="Mowing">Mowing</h2>

      <p>Yards small or Large, we offer weekly mowing, price dependant upon size, access and difficulty.
         Mowing service includes trimming and blowing grass clippings. 
         One time mowings also available. </p>
    
  </div>

  <div class="serveinfo">

      <h2 id="Trimming/Pruning">Trimming/Pruning</h2>

      <p>If your hedges, shrubs, bushes or small trees require pruning or trimming, 
        we would love to shape them for you. 
        However we do not specialize in work that requires a ladder,
        so if we can't reach it with a pole trimmer you may need to 
        contact a professional tree service. 
      </p>

  </div>

  <div class="serveinfo">

      <h2 id="Mulching">Mulching</h2>

      <P>If your flower beds need mulching we can provide many types of mulch in a variety of 
        colors depending on what our supplier has available. Bulk pricing for mulch is 
        available by the yard but if you have a specific bagged mulch we can pick up and 
        install that as well.</P>

  </div>

  <div class="serveinfo">

      <h2 id="Landscaping">Landscapping</h2>

      <p>If you require minor landscaping such as edging your flower bed, instalation or 
        removal of plants or shrubs and other things of this nature we would love to work 
        with you to make your dreams a reality! </p>

  </div>

  <div class="serveinfo">

      <h2 id="Aeration">Aeration</h2>

      <p>Available in Spring and Fall Aeration can help to alleviate soil compaction and 
        allow your grass to establish healthier deeper roots. </p>

  </div>

  <div class="serveinfo">

      <h2 id="Overseeding">Overseeding</h2>

      <p>Generally this service is coupled with Aeration to maximize effectiveness, overseeding utilizes a broadcast 
        spreader to evenly distribute seed to thicken existing lawns.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="serveinfo">

      <h2 id="Power Seeding">Power Seeding</h2>

      <p>While similar to overseeding;, power seeding is implemented for more extensive lawn repair
        or replacement. This process involves cutting grooves into the surface of the desired area and 
        seed being placed directly in the area that has been sliced open. 
      </p>

  </div>

  <div class="serveinfo">
      
        <h2 id="Leaf Removal">Leaf Removal</h2>

      <p>Every year trees drop their leaves. If leaves are not removed from 
        your lawn they can block sunlight, smother grass, and cause disease when left unatended. 
        our team will blow leaves to the curb and suck them up into our trailer and haul them off.
